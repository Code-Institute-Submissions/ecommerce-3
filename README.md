# The Alpha Beta Charlie Society

## Introduction

This Society is a community of individuals seeking financial freedom. To achieve their goal they must work together
culminating friends in the societies gaming platform. 

The platform is not a traditional gaming platform at all. In fact, the platform is a simple ecommerce marketplace where
the buyer becomes the seller and the seller becomes the buyer.

To make matters more confusing, the platform sells absolutely nothing. The site consists of two items known simply as
Beta and Charlie. Beta and Charlie are friendly bots who spend their virtual days looking for more friends. This is the
where the gamification of the ecommerce platform comes to light.

The idea was born on the notion that you could not create an ecommerce platform that sold nothing. The sites creator is
a student of Code Institute and the project itself was born out of necessity because the coursework required students to
develop an ecommerce solution as the last in a series of milestone projects. While contemplating ideas for the site the
creator wanted to try something new. Something that was way outside of the box and this is when it dawned on him that
there was no real need to actually use the platform to sell items and/or services. There was nothing in the directive that
specified you had to so the concept quickly started to focus on the possibility of creating a platform that sells
absolutely nothing while at the same time has the potential to earn a substantial amount of wealth for those that engaged
with it.

Once the idea was envisioned the name came immediately. The creator was already fixated on a site name that contained the
word alpha because alpha often represents the first of something and often the best of something. This project was going
to be the creators first, or alpha django project so it made sense to him to want to intern the word alpha into the project
name. Beta was introduced because the project is a beta that will be used as an mvp. Charlie naturally followed because
of the urban alphabet known to the author as alpha beta charlie. Alpha Beta Charlie is a phonetic alphabet used to
spell words over radio transmissions. Alpha for the letter A, Beta for the letter B, Charlie for the letter C and so on.
There is an actual alphabet with a dictionary known as the Nato Phonetic Dictionary which defines the code word and
pronunciation for each of the 26 letters of the english ALPHAbet, non pun intended, lol.

You can view that dictionary here: http://www.alphabravocharlie.info/alphabet.php
Further credit's associated to the origin information related to the NATO dictionary is available on the reference site
listed above.

The idea to create a society built around generating something from nothing through an ecommerce gaming platform was'nt
as easy to imagine as the naming of the project. Originally the concept was to sell Alpha's on the site which would
spawn Beta and Charlie transactions the users could turn-a-round and sell for a profit. But when designing the workflow
for that concept it seemed a bit illogical considering the site was not supposed to be selling anything in the first place.

To solve the issue it was determined that the Alpha transaction could be used to allow the user
to donate a small fee to the society in exchange for a Beta and Charlie set which they could use to find new friends
willing to donate to their cause. This way, the site is not selling anything. There is also another added benefit in that
Alpha is no used to generate Beta and Charlie. Alpha is user associated with Beta and Charlie transactions.
