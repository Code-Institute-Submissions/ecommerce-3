Corrections were made to improve responsiveness. More work needs to be done for site to be fully responsive.","","1. Tested PC version using google chrome inspect tool","2. Tested Mobile and Tablet versions manually by visiting each page","","Alternatively:","","1. Visit the hosted version of the","   [website](https://decoder-cookbook.herokuapp.com/get_index)","","Tests concluded site is not fully responsive in mobile displays but are","compliant in tablet and pc.","","### User Stories","1. A student wants to check to see if a recipe exists for a bug they","   have encountered.","   -  From the Q & A page the user can sift through questions raised in","      hopes of finding a solution.

A tutor can publish recipes to common issues they answer for students","   so that in future student interactions they can direct the student to","   their solution published in the cookbook","   -  Just as students would the tutor can access the questions form to","      lodge a problem question and use the same form in edit mode to","      submit the recipe needed to solve the problem raised by the","      initial question.","3.

It is run using Live","Server plugin for PyCharm.","","## Known Bugs","","- Site not responsive on smallest screens","- Picklist on the add_task form is pulling data from Mongodb units","  collection

Corrections were made to improve responsiveness. More work needs to be done for site to be fully responsive.","","1. Tested PC version using google chrome inspect tool","2. Tested Mobile and Tablet versions manually by visiting each page","","Alternatively:","","1. Visit the hosted version of the","   [website](https://decoder-cookbook.herokuapp.com/get_index)","","Tests concluded site is not fully responsive in mobile displays but are","compliant in tablet and pc.","","### User Stories","1.

A student can review advice and tips related to various aspects of","   the course work they are undertaking. On the Sound Advise page they","   will find helpful hints and tips necessary to successfully navigate","   the course.","","## Deployment","","The project is hosted on","[Heorku](https://decoder-cookbook.herokuapp.com/get_index)","","The process involved:","- Host a git repository on GitHub. Explained [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo).","- The root folder contains README.md and index.html files","- On GitHub repository settings page move to GitHub Pages section"," ","To deploy your own version of the website:","- Have git installed","- Visit the [repository]([GitHub](https://github.com/Jmcclain0129/decoder_cookbook))","- Click 'Clone or download' and copy the code for http","- Open your chosen IDE (Cloud9, VS Code, etc.)","- Open a terminal in your root directory","- Type 'git clone ' followed by the code taken from github repository","    - ```git clone https://github.com/Pattern-Projects/oireachtas-ifd-project.git```","- When this completes you have your own version of the website","    - Feel free to make any changes to it","- The website can be run by opening one of the HTML files within a web browser","- Visit the link provided","- Your website with any made changes will appear","- Saved changes to the website will appear here after refreshing the page","","The benefits of hosting your website on GitHub pages is that any pushed changes to your project will automatically update the website.

To achieve their goal they must work together","culminating friends in the societies gaming platform. ","","The platform is not a traditional gaming platform at all. In fact, the platform is a simple ecommerce marketplace where","the buyer becomes the seller and the seller becomes the buyer.","","To make matters more confusing, the platform sells absolutely nothing. The site consists of two items known simply as","Beta and Charlie. Beta and Charlie are friendly bots who spend their virtual days looking for more friends. This is the","where the gamification of the ecommerce platform comes to light.","","The idea was born on the notion that you could not create an ecommerce platform that sold nothing. The sites creator is","a student of Code Institute and the project itself was born out of necessity because the coursework required students to","develop an ecommerce solution as the last in a series of milestone projects. While contemplating ideas for the site the","creator wanted to try something new. Something that was way outside of the box and this is when it dawned on him that","there was no real need to actually use the platform to sell items and/or services. There was nothing in the directive that","specified you had to so the concept quickly started to focus on the possibility of creating a platform that sells","absolutely nothing while at the same time has the potential to earn a substantial amount of wealth for those that engaged","with it.","","Once the idea was envisioned the name came immediately. The creator was already fixated on a site name that contained the","word alpha because alpha often represents the first of something and often the best of something. This project was going","to be the creators first, or alpha django project so it made sense to him to want to intern the word alpha into the project","name. Beta was introduced because the project is a beta that will be used as an mvp. Charlie naturally followed because","of the urban alphabet known to the author as alpha beta charlie. Alpha Beta Charlie is a phonetic alphabet used to","spell words over radio transmissions. Alpha for the letter A, Beta for the letter B, Charlie for the letter C and so on.","There is an actual alphabet with a dictionary known as the Nato Phonetic Dictionary which defines the code word and","pronunciation for each of the 26 letters of the english ALPHAbet, non pun intended, lol.","","You can view that dictionary here: http://www.alphabravocharlie.info/alphabet.php","Further credit's associated to the origin information related to the NATO dictionary is available on the reference site","listed above.","","The idea to create a society built around generating something from nothing through an ecommerce gaming platform was'nt","as easy to imagine as the naming of the project. Originally the concept was to sell Alpha's on the site which would","spawn Beta and Charlie transactions the users could turn-a-round and sell for a profit. But when designing the workflow","for that concept it seemed a bit illogical considering the site was not supposed to be selling anything in the first place.","","To solve the issue it was determined that the Alpha transaction could be used to allow the user","to donate a small fee to the society in exchange for a Beta and Charlie set which they could use to find new friends","willing to donate to their cause. This way, the site is not selling anything. There is also another added benefit in that","Alpha is no used to generate Beta and Charlie. Alpha is user associated with Beta and Charlie transactions.","","To learn more about the Alpha Beta Charlie Society visit the website here:","https://jmc-django-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/accounts/home/","","","Hosted on ","[HerokuÂ Pages](https://jmc-django-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/)","Repository on","[GitHub](https://github.com/Jmcclain0129/ecommerce)","","## License","","The project is shared for use with the [GNU General Public License v3](https://github.com/Pattern-Projects/oireachtas-ifd-project/blob/master/LICENSE)","",">   This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify","    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by","    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or","    (at your option) any later version."],"id":31}],[{"start":{"row":51,"column":7},"end":{"row":51,"column":8},"action":"remove","lines":["Â "],"id":32}],[{"start":{"row":51,"column":7},"end":{"row":51,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":33}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":952,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":55,"column":10},"end":{"row":55,"column":10},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":42,"state":"start","mode":"ace/mode/markdown"}},"timestamp":1567965314490,"hash":"db6626a1441c5a93c97c58173ec148900545ad67"}
